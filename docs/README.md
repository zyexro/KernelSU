## How to add
```
curl -LSs "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rsuntk/KernelSU/main/kernel/setup.sh" | bash -s main
```

## Hook method

1. `KPROBES` hook
2. Manual hook (For GKI: Use `#ifdef CONFIG_KSU_MANUAL_HOOK` instead of `#ifdef CONFIG_KSU` for guard certain kernelsu hook)

## Features

1. Kernel-based `su` and root access management.
2. Module system based on [5ec1cff's Magic Mount API on KernelSU](https://github.com/5ec1cff/KernelSU)
3. [App Profile](https://kernelsu.org/guide/app-profile.html): Lock up the root power in a cage.
4. Bringing back non-GKI/GKI 1.0 support

## Compatibility State

KernelSU (before v1.0.0) officially supports Android GKI 2.0 devices (kernel 5.10+). Older kernels (4.14+) are also compatible, but the kernel will have to be built manually.

With this, WSA, ChromeOS, and container-based Android are all supported.

Currently, only `arm64-v8a` are supported.

## Usage
